# On-Loop

Spec-driven SDLC workflows for AI coding tools: a native [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugin and portable Agent Skills for Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and compatible hosts. Specialist roles guide a full development lifecycle with security-first engineering practices.

## What It Does

`/on-loop` takes a prompt and runs it through a complete software development pipeline:

```
Prompt → Worktree → Branch → Spec → Plan → Code → Test → Security → Docs + Build → Review → Commit + Push + PR → Done
```

Each phase is handled by a specialist agent operating as a Staff Engineer with ISC2 certifications, building for regulated financial environments and critical infrastructure.

The native Claude plugin gives each session its own **git worktree**, so multiple sessions can run concurrently on the same repo without interference. Portable workflows follow the host's workspace policy and reuse isolated cloud checkouts. Session logs are persisted in the repo as an audit trail.

## Installation

### Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other Agent Skills hosts

From this checkout, export the workflows into your project (Python 3.9+):

```bash
python3 bin/on-loop-export --tool codex --destination /path/to/your-project
# Other targets: --tool gemini, --tool opencode, --tool agent-skills
```

The portable workflows use the model/provider selected in your coding tool.
They retain the existing roles and quality gates, with sequential execution when
delegation is unavailable. See [portable tool setup](docs/portable-tools.md) for
invocation, permissions, and differences from the native Claude plugin.

### Claude Code

### Option 1: Marketplace (recommended)

Add the on-loop marketplace, then install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add joestein/on-loop
```

This registers the marketplace from the repo's `marketplace.json`. Then install the plugin:

```
/plugin install on-loop
```

That's it — all `/on-loop` commands are now available in your Claude Code sessions.

> **How it works**: The `marketplace.json` at the repo root declares available plugins. When you run `/plugin marketplace add`, Claude Code fetches this manifest and makes the listed plugins available for install. `/plugin install` then activates the plugin, loading its commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

### Option 2: Clone to plugins directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/on-loop.git ~/.claude/plugins/on-loop
```

### Option 3: Symlink

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/on-loop.git ~/dev/on-loop
ln -s ~/dev/on-loop ~/.claude/plugins/on-loop
```

### Option 4: Project-local

Clone or copy into your project and reference it in your project's Claude Code configuration.

## Safe release tagging

On 2026-05-20, untracked `.on-loop/sessions/` files caused `git pull` to abort silently (git refuses to overwrite untracked paths). The local branch was left one commit behind `origin/main`. The developer did not notice, signed the tag, and `v0.2.3` was created against the previous release's commit. The Quay image for v0.2.3 therefore contained v0.2.2 code.

`on-loop-tag` is a pre-flight gate that runs eight checks before invoking `git tag -s`, and writes an immutable NDJSON audit line to `.on-loop/release-log.json` on every outcome (success, refusal, or emergency bypass). The exact precondition of the v0.2.3 incident is caught by checks 5 and 6.

```bash
# Normal — all eight checks must pass
on-loop-tag v0.6.2 -m "release: v0.6.2"

# Dry run — check only, no tag, no audit line
on-loop-tag v0.6.2 -m "release: v0.6.2" --check

# Emergency bypass — all checks still run; failures become warnings
on-loop-tag v0.6.2 -m "hotfix" --force --reason "CI down, hotfix for prod INC-4892"
```

After a successful tag, push manually: `git push origin v0.6.2`

See [`bin/on-loop-tag.md`](bin/on-loop-tag.md) for the full manual: all eight checks, exit codes, audit log schema, `--force` policy, security considerations, and install trade-offs.

Installed to `~/.local/bin/on-loop-tag` by `setup/fedora-bootstrap.sh`.

This tool implements the **canonical-state-verification iteration** of [mise-en-place Principle 5 (Justified Action / Five Whys), §5 Forward](https://github.com/UlyssesModel/mise-en-place/blob/main/skills/mise-en-place/references/contract.md#5-justified-action) — applied to `git tag` operations. The eight pre-flight checks are the reference pattern for destructive-op tooling; the discipline generalizes to schema migrations, deployments, and any irreversible operation. See mise-en-place v0.5.1 (2026-05-21) for the architectural authority.

## Agents

The native Claude plugin uses the defaults below. Portable skills inherit the
host's model selection for every role.

| Agent | Claude default | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| Orchestrator | Opus | Pipeline control, quality gates, retry logic, worktree/session lifecycle |
| Architect | Opus | Spec generation, ADRs, system design |
| Coding | Opus | Implementation with security-first practices |
| Testing | Sonnet | Unit, integration, and E2E tests |
| Security | Opus | OWASP/STRIDE audit, compliance checks (read-only) |
| Documentation | Sonnet | READMEs, guides, CLAUDE.md files |
| Build | Sonnet | Makefile, GitHub Actions, lint/security configs |
| Reviewer | Opus | Final code review gate (read-only) |

### Worktree Isolation

Each session creates a git worktree at `.claude/worktrees/<branch-slug>/`, providing an independent working directory. This means:

- Multiple `/on-loop` sessions can run concurrently on the same repo
- The user's working directory is never modified during a loop run
- Each session has its own branch and isolated file state
- Worktrees share the git object store, so they are space-efficient

### Session Logs

Each session persists its state under `.on-loop/sessions/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_branch-slug>/`:

```
.on-loop/
├── index.json                  # Manifest of all sessions
└── sessions/
    ├── 20260426_143052_user-management-api/
    │   ├── state.json          # Phase tracking
    │   ├── plan.md             # Implementation plan
    │   ├── changes.log         # File modification log
    │   └── agent-notes/        # Per-agent structured output
    └── 20260426_150311_auth-middleware/
        └── ...
```

Session directories are named with timestamps for chronological sorting and branch slugs for human readability.

Session directories are committed to the repo as audit logs, providing a record of what the AI agents did, decided, and found.

### Quality Gates

Each phase transition is validated:

| Transition | Key Criteria |
|-----------|--------------|
| CODE -> TEST | Code compiles, no self-reported critical issues |
| TEST -> SECURITY | All tests pass |
| SECURITY -> DOC/BUILD | No critical/high security findings |
| REVIEW -> GIT | Reviewer approves |
| GIT -> COMPLETE | Commit, push, PR created |

Failed gates trigger retries (TEST->CODE: 3x, SECURITY->CODE: 2x, REVIEW->CODE: 2x). After exhaustion, issues are recorded as TODOs and the pipeline continues.

## Agent Persona

All agents operate as **Staff Software Engineers** with ISC2 certifications (CISSP, CCSP, CSSLP, ISSAP, ISSEP, ISSMP) targeting:

- Regulated financial services (banking, trading, insurance)
- Critical infrastructure
- Multi-tenant SaaS

Security principles: zero trust, defense in depth, least privilege, fail secure, secure by default.

Compliance awareness: SOC2, PCI-DSS, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, GDPR.

## Example Usage

### Full SDLC Loop

```
/on-loop Create a REST API for user management with JWT authentication, role-based access control, and PostgreSQL storage
```

### Concurrent Sessions

```
# Terminal 1
/on-loop Add user registration with email verification

# Terminal 2 (same repo, different Claude Code session)
/on-loop Add password reset flow with OTP
```

Each runs in its own worktree — no conflicts.

### Standalone Commands

```
/on-security src/auth/           # Audit auth module
/on-test src/api/handlers.ts     # Generate tests for handlers
/on-doc                          # Document the entire project
/on-review                       # Review all uncommitted changes
```

### Resume After Interruption

```
/on-loop-status                           # Check all sessions
/on-loop-resume                           # Resume most recent active/failed session
/on-loop-resume --session=20260426_143052_user-api --from=TEST  # Resume specific session
```

### Cleanup

```
/on-loop:clear                  # Remove worktrees, keep session logs
/on-loop:clear --include-logs   # Remove everything
```
